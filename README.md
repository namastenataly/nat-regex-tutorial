## Understanding the URL Regex (Module 17)

# Description

Welcome to the **URL Regex Tutorial**! This tutorial breaks down a commonly used regular expression designed to match and validate URLs.

We‚Äôll explore each part of the regex step-by-step to understand how it captures elements like the protocol (`http`, `https`), subdomains (like `www.`), domain names, top-level domains (`.com`, `.org`), and optional paths.

The goal of this tutorial is to help you confidently **read, understand, and apply** this regex pattern in real-world development scenarios, including form validation and web scraping.
